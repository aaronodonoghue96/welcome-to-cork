                <h2>Activities In Cork</h2>
                <p>
                    Cork offers a multitude of activities for tourists from all walks of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the city, there is the Cork City Bus Tour, which is a 75-minute hop-on hop-off
                    bus that takes you around Cork City, showing you a variety of historical locations,
                    with an audio description detailing information about each site and its significance
                    along the journey. It runs from April to September each year, every 45 minutes in
                    peak months (May-August) and every 90 minutes in off-peak months (April and September),
                    starting from 9:00am, with the last tour each day at 4:15pm (peak) or 3:30pm (off-peak).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slightly outside the city centre, and on the route of the aforementioned bus tour, there
                    is Cork City Gaol, a former jail that has been reconstructed as a museum of the jail's
                    history. There is an audio guided tour available, detailing information about what life
                    was like at the time, information about the inmates and about the jail itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Marina Market, a trendy new addition to Cork since 2021, is just outside the city centre,
                    and boasts a wide variety of places to eat, buy clothes, and do shopping in general, and
                    in the winter, it is also home to Santa's Magical Market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of Cork City but within County Cork are two additional popular destinations, Cobh
                    and Midleton. Cobh is a historical town, known for being where the Titanic began its
                    journey from. Tourist attractions here include the Queenstown Story at the Cobh Heritage
                    Centre and the Titanic Experience, and there is also a boat from Cobh to Spike Island,
                    another nearby tourist attraction that was previously used as a prison and for military purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midleton is known for being where Jameson whiskey is distilled, and a number of different tours
                    of the distillery take place year round. You can also book tasting sessions to try the whiskey
                    for yourself.
