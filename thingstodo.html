                <h2>Activities In Cork</h2>
                <p>
                    Cork offers a multitude of activities for tourists from all walks of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the city, there is the Cork City Bus Tour, which is a 75-minute hop-on hop-off
                    bus that takes you around Cork City, showing you a variety of historical locations,
                    with an audio description detailing information about each site and its significance 
                    along the journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slightly outside the city centre, and on the route of the aforementioned bus tour, there
                    is Cork City Gaol, a former jail that has been reconstructed as a museum of the jail's 
                    history. There is an audio guided tour available, detailing information about what life
                    was like at the time, information about the inmates and about the jail itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of Cork City but within County Cork are two additional popular destinations, Cobh
                    and Midleton. Cobh is a historical town, known for being where the Titanic began its
                    journey from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midleton is known for being where Jameson whiskey is distilled.
                </p>
