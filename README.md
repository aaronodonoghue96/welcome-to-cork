# welcome-to-cork
A website about things to do and see in Cork


Fixed Bugs:
Links in nav bar were displaying in standard blue/purple with underline and bullet points because CSS link was not updated to account for the fact style.css was moved to the css folder. The path is now updated in all pages, and the links are displaying correctly.
