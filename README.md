# Welcome To cork

Welcome To Cork is a website about the city of Cork, which tells users a bit about the city, some things to do in Cork, and shows pictures of places to visit in Cork. It is targeted at tourists who are looking for an idea of where to go on their next holiday, and those who want to see what Cork has to offer.

Welcome To Cork will be useful to tourists to inform them about Cork, giving them a brief overview of different types of places to visit, such as historical sites, places of entertainment and culture, and restaurants. It may also be useful for people living in Cork to discover hidden gems within their own city, and gain a new appreciation for Cork.

## Testing

This project has been tested on the Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers, and in both cases, no problems with display or rendering were found.

The Home page (index.html) has been tested on all screen resolutions available on Dev Tools, and in all cases, the main image displays correctly and is visible, the sections below in the info section display in the correct layout based on the screen size, and the red links at the bottom of the page display in line with the surrounding text in the sentence they are part of.

The Pictures page (pictures.html) has been tested on all screen resolutions available on Dev Tools, and in all cases, the images display in the correct layout, are visible, and the captions below them are visible.

The Things To Do page (thingstodo.html) has been tested on all screen resolutions available on Dev Tools, and in all cases, the screen displays correctly, the content is readable, and the form displays in the correct layout.

The nav bar has been confirmed to display correctly on both small screens and large screens using Dev Tools, showing the links on the right with the large screens, and showing the hamburger icon instead on small screens, which when clicked, toggles the display of links.

All of the above were also tested by manually resizing the browser window, which also allowed me to test that the nav bar will revert to displaying on the right when the screen is maximized after being reduced, and the links will be in the same place they started in.
